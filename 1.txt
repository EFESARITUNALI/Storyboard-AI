Under the moonlight, an evil warlock with pale skin, dark robes, and a hood that shadows his face, sneaks into the Temple of Light. The temple is an imposing structure, with towering spires and intricate stained glass windows. The warlock breaks into a chamber where a mystical orb, radiating a soft glow, levitates above an altar. He reaches for the Orb of Dawn, his eyes gleaming with malicious intent.
