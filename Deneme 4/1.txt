The city of Lumina is in chaos as the tech-savvy thief, Shadow, takes advantage of the blackout to steal the energy core, a crystal that powers the entire metropolis. Shadow is shown as a slender person with agile movements, their face obscured by a high-tech mask, and dressed in black, stealth-enhancing clothing. They navigate through the city's security systems with ease, their eyes glowing with a digital interface. In contrast, we see Aria, a young woman with a determined expression, her eyes shining with intelligence. She is dressed in a futuristic engineer's outfit, complete with a headset and a tool belt. In secret, she has developed a powerful suit that harnesses Lumina's remaining energy, the suit glowing with a vibrant blue light, standing out against the dark cityscape.
