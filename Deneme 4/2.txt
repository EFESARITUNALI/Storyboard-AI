Aria, the brilliant engineer, steps into the frame, her suit glowing with a faint light, the only source of illumination in the dark city. Her face is determined, and her brown hair is pulled back in a practical ponytail. She is on the hunt for Shadow, the thief who has just stolen Lumina's energy core. In her hand, she holds a small tracking device, leading her through the labyrinthine streets and alleys of Lumina. The background is a dark and mysterious cityscape, with the neon lights of Lumina now extinguished.
