Inside a grand hall, an old man with a long white beard, wearing a hooded robe, stands before a massive stone tablet. The tablet is engraved with ancient runes, foretelling a prophecy. The temple is adorned with intricate carvings and statues, bathed in a golden light from the setting sun. The old man, with a concerned expression, gazes upon the prophecy, foreseeing the impending darkness.
