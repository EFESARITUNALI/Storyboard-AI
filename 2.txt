In a hidden chamber of the temple, lit by flickering torches, a young man with a determined expression and a shaved head, wearing a simple white robe, packs his bag with supplies. He has a distinctive birthmark on his cheek. He is the temple acolyte, and he studies an enchanted map that reveals hidden passages and traps within the temple. He is determined to stop the warlock and protect the balance between day and night.
