High above the city, in the tallest chamber of the temple, the young acolyte confronts the evil warlock. The room is circular, with arched windows overlooking the city of Seraphis. The warlock, his back to the window, raises his hands, summoning dark magic. The acolyte, standing near the altar, holds the Orb of Dawn in one hand and performs ancient spells with the other, sending bolts of light toward the warlock.
